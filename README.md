## Libraries Used in the Frontend
This project uses several libraries for its operation:
- **@emotion/react** and **@emotion/styled**: Libraries for writing CSS styles with JavaScript, providing powerful and predictable style composition in addition to a great developer experience with features such as source maps, labels, and testing utilities.
- **@mui/material**: A popular React UI framework with a robust set of components for building rich, interactive user interfaces.
- **@splinetool/react-spline**: A library for creating 3D web experiences.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.
- **Framer-motion**: A library that provides animations and transitions for complex React components.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **Next-auth**: A complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications.
- **React** and **React-dom**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React-dom is the glue between React and the DOM.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.


## Libraries Used in the Backend
This project uses several libraries for its operation:
- **Node.js**: a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: a back-end web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: a document database, which enables working with large amounts of data efficiently and securely.
- **Axios**: a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **Body-parser**: Node.js body parsing middleware.
- **Cookie-parser**: a middleware which parses cookies attached to the client request object.
- **Cors**: a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
- **Dotenv**: a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **Express-rate-limit**: a middleware for express routes that rate-limits incoming requests.
- **Express-session**: a session middleware for Express.
- **Jsonwebtoken**: an implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
- **Mongoose**: a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- **Passport**: an authentication middleware for Node.js.

## Description
This project contains the logic and functionality of the backend for our application.
It uses Node.js as the runtime environment, Express.js to handle server requests and responses,
and MongoDB as our database to store and retrieve information.
.
## Project Deployment in the Backend
Sure, hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to locally deploy your backend project:
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the necessary programming tools installed on your system.
   This includes Node.js, npm, and a code editor of your choice (like Visual Studio Code).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Coin Latam repository from GitHub using
   the following command in your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/julianvidela/coin-latam.git`
3. **Navigate to the API Folder**: Open a terminal and navigate to the `api` folder
   within the cloned repository: `cd coin-latam/api`
4. **Install Dependencies**: In the same terminal, run the following command to download
   the project dependencies: `npm install`   
5. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.
   Make sure to replace `YOUR_VALUE` with your actual values:
6. **Run the Project**: Finally, execute the following command to start the server
   in development mode: `npm run dev`
Now, your server should be running locally and you can start testing its functionalities.

## Project Deployment in the Frontend
1. **Navigate to the Client Folder**: Open a terminal and navigate to the `client`
  folder within your project directory: `cd coin-latam/client`
2. **Install Dependencies**: In the same terminal, run the following command to download the project dependencies: `npm install`
3. **Run the Project**: Finally, execute the following command to start the server in
  development mode: `npm run dev`
Now, your server should be running locally. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
Remember, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system to perform these steps.
